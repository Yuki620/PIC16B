# Work and Experience

## Academia Sinica - Research Intern

- Checked the validity of a mathematical model of biofilm oscillations presented in a research paper and modified it
- Wrote new ODE models and solved them in Python using RK4 and ran simulations in NetLogo to see how the models would
behave as individual-based models

## Mechanics Bank Auto Finance - Auto Risk Analyst

- Worked in the originations scorecard development team to build a higher accuracy scorecard to minimize the overallocation of resources for risk. This would have freed up resources that could be used towards the current expansion of the bank.
- Pulled, cleaned, and prepared the data to build the development database for a new custom originations scorecard using SAS, SQL, and Excel
- Built a preliminary logistic inference model for the scorecard with SQL and SAS
- Built a finalized version of an inference model that will generate loss predictions with more accuracy Mechanics Bank Auto

# Relevant Projects

## IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis

- Used Python to do NLP and conduct sentiment analysis on the movie reviews left on the IMDB website
- Examined various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, logistic regression with SGD, KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Trees under both BoW and TF-IDF

## Amazon Price Tracking Bot

- Used Python to create a bot that checks the price of a product at 8:00 a.m. every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.
- If the price drops below our target price, then the bot sends an email to notify the user of the price drop.
- Used BeautifulSoup for web scraping, the SMTP module to send the emails, and crontab to keep the script active.
