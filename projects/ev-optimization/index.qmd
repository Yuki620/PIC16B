### Project Summary

This project develops an optimization model to identify optimal placement and sizing of Level 2 EV chargers in Boston neighborhoods to meet 2050 demand projections. Our objective is to balance accessibility, cost, and efficiency under budget constraints using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation.

- Built a cost-minimizing location allocation model using Boston census data, ChargePoint pricing, and AFDC station records
- Simulated housing unit locations and projected demand across neighborhoods based on adoption scenarios from the Boston Zero Emission Roadmap
- Focused initial scaling and model validation on Dorchester, Bostonâ€™s largest and most diverse neighborhood
- Achieved 100% residential coverage with 213 chargers across 27 optimized stations, using only 68% of the available budget
- Outperformed heuristic methods (e.g., hub-based siting at parks and schools) in terms of coverage and cost-efficiency

### Objective Function
Minimize total cost of station and charger installation:

$$
\min_{x, y, u, x', u'} \sum_{j \in F_k} \sum_{k \in N} (c x_{jk} + g u_{jk}) + \sum_{j \in F'_k} \sum_{k \in N} (c x'_{jk} + g u'_{jk})
$$
