Hi! Iâ€™m Yuki Yu, a Master of Analytics student at MIT and a recent graduate of UCLA, where I double majored in Applied Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science.
I focus on applying advanced analytics, optimization, and machine learning to solve real-world problems. My interests lie in using data to drive strategic decisions, uncover meaningful patterns, and design systems that are both efficient and impactful.

Learn more about me through my [Resume](/Resume.pdf "Resume").
