    "text": "Project Summary\nThis project develops an optimization model to identify optimal placement and sizing of Level 2 EV chargers in Boston neighborhoods to meet 2050 demand projections. Our objective is to balance accessibility, cost, and efficiency under budget constraints using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation.\n\nBuilt a cost-minimizing location allocation model using Boston census data, ChargePoint pricing, and AFDC station records\nSimulated housing unit locations and projected demand across neighborhoods based on adoption scenarios from the Boston Zero Emission Roadmap\nFocused initial scaling and model validation on Dorchester, Bostonâ€™s largest and most diverse neighborhood\nAchieved 100% residential coverage with 213 chargers across 27 optimized stations, using only 68% of the available budget\nOutperformed heuristic methods (e.g., hub-based siting at parks and schools) in terms of coverage and cost-efficiency\n\n\n\n\nObjective Function\nMinimize total cost of station and charger installation:\n\\[\n\\min_{x, y, u, x', u'} \\sum_{j \\in F_k} \\sum_{k \\in N} (c x_{jk} + g u_{jk}) + \\sum_{j \\in F'_k} \\sum_{k \\in N} (c x'_{jk} + g u'_{jk})\n\\]\n\n\nFinal Deliverables\nFor the full formulation and the step-by-step process, please see the full report!\n\nDownload full report (PDF)\n\nDownload slides"
